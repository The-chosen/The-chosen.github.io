# 1. Intro to data science

## 1. Definition of data science
- Data science != machine learning
![image.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/10/11/sp8ZXjfQlT1Dvun.png)
- Def: The scientific process of extracting value from data

## 2. What do data scientists do
Data scientists ask interesting questions & answer them with data

## 3. Questions
- What questions should I ask on a first date?
- Studying coordinated migration
- How do I improve ride sharing?

## 4. About this course
- This is a 'survey' course.
- Topics:
    - Data Science & Ethics
    - Version Control & Programming
    - Data & Data Wrangling
    - Data Visualization & Communication
    - Approaches to Data Analysis
- Exams:
    - Mon Oct 21st - “What is Data Science” through “Data Wrangling”
    - Mon Dec 2nd - “Data Visualization” through Guest Lectures

# 2. Ethics

## 1. About Reading1
- What points were made that you had not previously considered?
- What points do you agree with? With which do you disagree?
- What do you not understand? (Ask questions about these in section!)
- What points/topics do you think are missing?
- Does anything differ with what you’ve learned in other classes? Other papers/books?
- What ideas did this reading give you? What do you want to go learn more about?

# 3. Data science questions

## 1. Data science process
- ask an instreresting question
- get the data
- explore the data
- model the data
- communicate and visualize the results

## 2. Question
- Be specific
- Be answerable with data
- Specify what’s being measured

# 4. Reproducibility
## 1. Definition of reproducibility
Re-performing the same analysis (with the same code) using a different analyst

## 2. Why haven’t we always been reproducible?
- Data science education and effective communication can improve these!
  - Lack of statistical literacy
  - Lack of computational literacy
- These can largely be addressed with fairly simple changes!
  - Failure to publish code
  - Lack of mechanism for peer-reviewing code
  - Lack of transparency in review of papers
- Others
  - Lack of incentive / funds

## 3. Definition of Replicable
Re-performing the experiment and collecting new data

Replicability is harder than reproducibility(Because the data is different & data is variable)

Defin: The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team using
the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same
operating conditions, in the same or a different location on multiple trials.

## 4. Why would a study fail to replicate?
- Finding was not “real” (or small effect)
- Measurement error
- Variable finding (i.e. time)
- Different population
- Different experimental design or conditions

## 5. Confirmation Bias
A cognitive bias wherein humans have a tendency to search for, interpret,
favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting
beliefs or hypotheses.

# 5. Programming
## 1. workflow => Think-Try-Read
1. Think about what it is you want to do.
2. Try it out.
    1. If you succeed, awesome.
    2. If not, continue on...
3. Read to try to figure out the answer (Google/Stack Overflow/books/your friend/etc.).
4. Wash, Rinse, Repeat.

# 6. File management 
## 1. Version Control
A way to manage the evolution of a set of files
- Enables multiple people to simultaneously work on a single project.
- Each person edits their own copy of the files and chooses when to share those
changes with the rest of the team.
- Thus, temporary or partial edits by one person do not interfere with another
person's work

## 2. File name
- Machine readable
- Human readable
- Nicely ordered

# 7. Data
## 1. Variable Types
- Quantitative
  - Integers (whole numbers, i.e. 10)
  - Continuous: Float or Numeric (200.78)
- Qualitative
  - String or Character (“Hello World”)
  - Categorical or Discrete (limited number of options) - (i.e. minor, adult)

## 2. categorize data storage
- Semi-structured*
  - spreadsheets (tabular data)
  - JSON & XML
- Structured
  - relational databases (SQL)
- Unstructured
  - everything else: video, audio, images, websites, apps, text, etc.

Data Scientists work with semi-structured data most frequently, but have to familiar with and comfortable in all types

# 8. Getting data
## 1. Where
1. All in nice spreadsheet
- Open data
  - www.kaggle.com
  - data.world
  ...

2. Not in nice spreadsheet
- HTTP(If there's API)
- WEB SCRAPING(If there's not API)

Use API
Accessing an API
1. Choose Method
2. Build URL
3. Get Authorization

# 9. Data wrangling
## 1. Tidy Data Benefits
1. consistent data structure
2. foster tool development
3. require only a small set of tools to be learned
4. allow for datasets to be combined

## 2. steps
- Step 1: Join columns from separate tables by ID
- Step 2: Select columns from
separate tables you want
included in your output
- Step 3: Arrange rows to order
by series and then by episode
- Step 4: Mutate & Summarize
to add columns

# 10. Data visualization

## 1. Information about a single set of numbers
1. Histograms: Range of possible height values is easily visualized
2. Densityplot: Demonstrates the distribution of the data (A smoothed version of a histogram)

## 2. Relationship between two numerical variables
1. Scatteplot

## 3. Count of values within a categorical variable
1. Barplot: Can easily see that there are more females than males

## 4. Summary of numerical values across categories
1. Boxplot: The middle line represents the median & tells you the typical height for females and males

## 5. Effective ways to display data summaries
1. Table: Tables count as data visualizations!

# 11. Descriptive Data Analysis
## 1. Descriptive:
The goal of descriptive analysis is to understand the components of a data set, describe
what they are, and explain that description to others who might want to understand the data.

## 2. sampling & statistics
- Statistics: the science that deals with the **collection, classification, analysis, and interpretation of numerical facts or data**, and that, by use of mathematical theories of probability, imposes order and regularity on aggregates of more or less disparate elements.
- sampling: need to be random and no-bias

## 3. How to describe a dataset
- Shape: It’s critical to know the distribution of the variables in your dataset because certain statistical approaches can only be used with certain distributions.
- Size
- Central Tendency
- Missingness: It’s critical to know how many observations have missing data for variables of interest in your data.
- Variability

## 4. Outlier
- Data entry errors
- Poor sampling procedures
- Technical or mechanical error
- Unexpected changes in weather
- People providing inaccurate information

Caution: Observations should only be removed from your dataset if you have a valid reason to do so.

## 5. mean, median, and/or mode
The mode is the most frequently observed category
- Range: highest score - lowest score
- Interquartile Range (IQR): 75th percentile - 25th percentile
- variance: measures how close the values in the distribution are to the middle of the distribution - average squared difference of the scores from the mean
- standard deviation (SD): square-root of the variance
